# Introduction to computers

Here we collect proposed additions to an existing course as it is given at Jambanjelly Upper Basic School.

* Raspberry Pi hardware overview (analogous to the existing Desktop PC overview)
  * the board with its System-On-a-Chip configuration is similar to the main boards as found in tablets and phones
  * the Raspberry Pi bridges microcontroller concepts to mobile and personal computing technology
* Practical details and useful facts of SD storage cards
  * SD cards form an increasingly important storage medium as it is often the sole form of (extension) storage for mobile devices
