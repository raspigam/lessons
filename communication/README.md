# Online International Communication

Whether you need to ask the online community for some help with any Raspberry trouble you are bound to encounter,
or you would like to write a blog post on your latest project - it helps if you know some things about writing for an
international audience. It's nice to learn some tricks to convey your ideas better to possibly interested people.
Others might think different than you do, but you might also be able to show them how your thinking works, so they
can see your perspective. And you never know what someone else's perspective can do for your concept in return!
