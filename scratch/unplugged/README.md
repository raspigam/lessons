# Computer Science unplugged

At the moment there are only two Raspberry Pi computers in our Computer Lab.
The links below contain ideas how to create Computer Science lessons without having to use a computer at all, or take a hybrid
approach with mixed unplugged and plugged elements. E.g. teams of students first do a programming assignment by arranging cut out
laminated paper Scratch blocks on their desks and take turns actually entering their programs into Scratch on one of the
Pi computers.

  - A few types of blocks are missing; we set up a github repo to extend the bundle at https://github.com/raspigam/vector-scratch-blocks

* [My Robotic Friends](https://csedweek.org/files/CSEDrobotics.pdf)
  - Take turns being a robot and get programmed by your fellow team members
