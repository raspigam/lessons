# Programming with Scratch 2017

## Subjects in this course

* Introduction to the Raspberry Pi - we are running Scratch code on the Raspberry Pi
* Programming with Scratch - main topic
* Problem Solving - we can integrate the use of diverse strategies of problem solving into the process of programming
and debugging
* Graphic Design - when we need to create a sprite from scratch in Inkscape or from a picture taken with a smart phone
* Online Communication - through sharing Scratch projects online

## Outline

* What is Scratch?
  * The cat and a programming language
* Computing and Computational Thinking
  * Computers can help solving certain types of problems for us
* The Raspberry Pi computer
  * We program and execute Scratch programs on the Raspberry Pi
* Programming with Scratch
  * Sprites, the actors in our play
    * We discover what Sprites are, graphic representations we can control
    * We place two Sprites on the Stage, and set the background accordingly
  * Moving forward
    * We make one of the Sprites move and turn, following a pre-defined path
    * Computing concepts: Commands, Sequences
  * Collisions
    * We reprogram the Sprite that it keeps moving forward until it touches the other Sprite
    * Computing concepts: Repetition, Conditions, Selection
  * Something to tell
    * The Sprites engage in a turn-by-turn conversation where one Sprite greets and waits for the other to answer
    * Computing concepts: Concurrency
  * Changing the subject
    * Before the Sprites start talking our program can ask for a subject the attendee must provide by typing a word into
    an input field
    * The subject input is recorded into a variable, along with some adjectives the Sprites will choose from in their talk
    * Thereafter the Sprites start their conversation where they talk about the entered subject and say what they think
    about it by using a random adjective, selected from the input
    * Computing concepts: Interaction, Input, Variables, Randomness
  * Catching balls
    * One Sprite walks away and one remains to play a game of catching balls falling from the ceiling
    * We have to program the Sprite to respond to arrow key input from the keyboard so we can direct the Sprite to catch balls
    * For every ball caught the score needs to be increased
    * Computing concepts: Realtime interaction, Input, Randomness, Variables
  * Dance, dance, dance!
    * Assignment where students pick a song to play and program a choreography where they can make use of keyboard input
    to add interactivity
  * Quizz time
    * Assignment where students pick a subject, come up with a set of questions and answers on this subject, and
    program an interactive multiple-choice quizz with scoring
* Publishing our work online
  * We can submit Scratch programs to the MIT Scratch collaboration web page, where children, teachers and hobbyists alike
  post their projects to share them world wide
* Collaboration and exchange
  * We could get in touch online with another school to share our Quizz and Dance projects in a cultural exchange
  setting (at both sides students can create quizzes about local topics the other students can learn about, or create
  animations to exchange the characteristic types of local art/pop culture)
