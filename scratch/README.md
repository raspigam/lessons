# Lessons: Programming with Scratch

The Scratch programming lessons introduce the programming language and environment "Scratch" to pupils of age 10-15. 

Reading at https://scratch.mit.edu/educators we find:

The [Creative Computing Guide from Harvard](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide) takes the following perspective to
Scratch programming:
> Computer science and computing-related fields have long been introduced to young people
> in a way that is disconnected from their interests and values  â€“  emphasizing technical detail over creative
> potential. Creative computing supports the development of personal connections to computing, by drawing upon
> creativity, imagination, and interests.

From the https://www.dk.com/computercoding FAQ:
> Why should I learn computer coding?
>
>Creating computer games and programs can be a lot of fun, and helps to strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving skills.  Plus there is a shortage of good coders, and the number of jobs that require coding is set to increase.

> Why do computers need coding? Can't they do everything themselves?
>
>Computers might seem smart, but they're actually just boxes that follow instructions very accurately. Without instructions they wouldn't do anything.
