# Lessons: Programming with Scratch

The Scratch programming lessons introduce the programming language and environment "Scratch" to pupils of age 10-15. 

The [Creative Computing Guide from Harvard](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide) takes the perspective to
Scratch programming that Computer science and computing-related fields have long been introduced to young people
in a way that is disconnected from their interests and values  â€“  emphasizing technical detail over creative
potential. Creative computing supports the development of personal connections to computing, by drawing upon
creativity, imagination, and interests.
